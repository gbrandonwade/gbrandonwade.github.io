Welcome to "Responsible AI and Me" - a blog documenting one project manager's journey from AI curious to AI capable. If you're reading this, chances are you're on a similar path: intrigued by AI's possibilities but maybe not sure where to start, especially if you don't have a coding background.

## Who Am I?

I'm a project manager at American Electric Power here in Columbus, Ohio. I spent 2 years in financial reporting and analytics before transitioning into project management 4 years ago, where I've been managing complex projects, coordinating teams, and solving problems - skills that, as I'm learning, translate beautifully to the world of AI. But until recently, artificial intelligence felt like something happening "over there" in Silicon Valley, not something for everyday professionals like me.

That changed completely when I asked Claude to create a simple game.

## The Moment Everything Clicked

I was experimenting with AI tools, testing their limits, when I decided to ask Claude to build me a game - something mixing Snake and Flappy Bird. I was expecting maybe some basic code that I'd struggle to understand, perhaps something that wouldn't even work.

Instead, Claude delivered hundreds of lines of clean, functional code. I copied it, opened it in a browser, and there it was: a fully playable game. It worked seamlessly. No debugging needed. No programming knowledge required on my part.

My jaw dropped. My brain started churning immediately - what if I added this feature? What if I modified that mechanic? The possibilities felt endless.

That's when it hit me: this technology isn't just impressive - it's transformational. And it's not reserved for computer scientists and tech giants. It's accessible to anyone willing to learn how to communicate with it effectively.

## Why "Responsible AI"?

Here's the thing though - with great power comes great responsibility. As I dove deeper into AI, I started having those "oh no" moments. The ease and accessibility of these tools is incredible, but that same accessibility means AI could cause real harm in the wrong hands. Privacy, security, misinformation - these aren't abstract concerns anymore.

I believe it's on all of us - not just the developers - to ensure that AI development and deployment happens ethically. Everyone deserves access to trustworthy, safe, and fair AI tools. Security measures and responsible practices aren't just nice-to-haves; they're essential for protecting people's information and maintaining trust in these powerful systems.

That's what "responsible AI" means to me: leveraging these incredible capabilities while actively working to minimize harm and maximize benefit for everyone.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog is my real-time documentation of cracking into the AI world as a complete outsider. No computer science degree. No coding bootcamp. Just curiosity, determination, and a willingness to experiment.

I'm writing this for the other beginners out there - the project managers, marketers, teachers, accountants, and everyone else who sees AI's potential but doesn't know where to start. I want to show you that it's not only possible to learn about AI and put it to practical use, but that your non-technical background might actually be an advantage.

Here's the biggest misconception I've encountered so far: people think you need to know how to code to work with AI. You don't. What you need is ideas and drive. And honestly? AI can even help you with the ideas - you really just need to bring the drive.

## What's Coming Next

I'm planning to document everything as I go:

* **Tool reviews** - honest takes on AI platforms from a beginner's perspective
* **Prompt engineering experiments** - learning to communicate effectively with AI
* **Real projects** - I'm excited to build a stock analysis tool and maybe an interactive chess game for beginners
* **Lessons learned** - including the failures and frustrations along the way
* **Career insights** - exploring how AI skills can open new professional doors

## The Bigger Picture

I'm convinced that we're witnessing the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we work, create, and solve problems. The people who learn to work effectively with AI won't just have a competitive advantage - they'll be the ones shaping how this technology gets integrated into society.

I'm actually betting my career on this belief. I'm moving to Los Angeles soon and hoping to transition into the AI space as I get settled there. This blog isn't just about learning for fun - it's about documenting a real career pivot in real time.

But here's what I'm learning: you don't need to be a programmer to be part of this transformation. You need to be curious, ethical, and willing to experiment. Those are skills any of us can develop.

## Join Me on This Journey

Whether you're a complete AI beginner or someone who's been dabbling but wants to go deeper, I hope this blog becomes a useful resource for you. I'll be sharing everything - the wins, the mistakes, the "aha!" moments, and the head-scratching confusion.

Because if a project manager from Columbus, Ohio can learn to leverage AI responsibly and effectively - and maybe even pivot their entire career around it - so can you.

Let's figure this out together.
