Welcome to "Responsible AI and Me" - a blog documenting one project manager's journey from AI curious to AI capable. If you're reading this, chances are you're on a similar path: intrigued by AI's possibilities but maybe not sure where to start, especially if you don't have a coding background.

# Hello, I'm Brandon Wade - And Here's Why I Finally Stopped Waiting for Permission to Learn AI

*Six months ago, AI felt like something happening "over there" in Silicon Valley. Today? I'm building games, analyzing data, and completely rethinking my career path. If you're reading this feeling overwhelmed by all the AI hype, I felt exactly the same way.*

## You Don't Need a Computer Science Degree to Start

Here's what I discovered: I'm just a project manager at American Electric Power here in Columbus, Ohio. I spent 2 years in financial reporting before moving into project management 4 years ago. No coding background. No tech bootcamp. Just the usual professional toolkit - managing complex projects, coordinating teams, solving problems.

Sound familiar? 

I used to scroll past AI articles thinking, "This is too technical for me." Every headline promised revolutionary changes, but none of them felt accessible to someone like me. That changed completely when I decided to stop overthinking and just ask Claude to create a simple game.

## The Moment Everything Clicked (And Why Your Background Matters More Than You Think)

I was testing AI tools, pushing their limits, when I asked Claude to build me something mixing Snake and Flappy Bird. I expected maybe some basic code I'd struggle to understand. Something that probably wouldn't work.

Instead? Claude delivered hundreds of lines of clean, functional code. I copied it, opened it in a browser, and there it was: a fully playable game. No debugging needed. No programming knowledge required.

My jaw dropped. But here's the real secret - my brain immediately started churning with project manager questions: What if I added this feature? What if I modified that mechanic? How could I make this more user-friendly?

Those aren't programmer questions. Those are the exact skills I use every day at work. Problem-solving. User experience thinking. Project scoping.

**The breakthrough**: You don't need to learn how to code to work with AI. You need to learn how to think through problems and communicate clearly - skills you already have.

## Here's the Thing Though - Power Requires Responsibility

That jaw-dropping moment came with an immediate "oh no" realization. If I could build a functional game in minutes without any coding knowledge, what could someone with bad intentions accomplish just as easily?

Privacy violations. Misinformation campaigns. Deep fakes. These aren't abstract future concerns - they're happening right now, and the barrier to entry just keeps getting lower.

I believe everyone deserves access to trustworthy, safe AI tools. But that means all of us - not just developers - need to understand how to use these capabilities responsibly. We can't outsource ethics to Silicon Valley.

That's what this blog is really about: learning to leverage incredible AI capabilities while actively working to minimize harm and maximize benefit for everyone.

## What I'm Really Documenting Here

This isn't another "AI will change everything" blog. You've read enough of those. This is real-time documentation of someone figuring out AI from the outside, with zero technical background, while keeping ethics front and center.

I'm writing this for everyone who feels like they're already behind. The project managers scrolling past technical articles. The marketers wondering if they need to learn Python. The teachers, accountants, and consultants seeing AI everywhere but not knowing where to start.

**Here's what I've learned so far**: Your non-technical background isn't a disadvantage. It's actually an advantage. While technical people focus on how AI works, you focus on how it can solve real problems for real people.

## What's Coming Next (And Why I'm Betting My Career On This)

I'm documenting everything as I learn:

**Tool Reviews** - Honest takes from someone who doesn't care about technical specifications, just whether something actually helps me get work done

**Prompt Engineering Experiments** - Learning to communicate with AI like I learned to manage stakeholders - clearly, specifically, and with realistic expectations

**Real Projects** - Building a stock analysis tool that actually makes sense to regular investors, plus an interactive chess game for beginners (because why not?)

**Lessons Learned** - Including the failures, the confusion, and those moments when I definitely bit off more than I could chew

**Career Insights** - I'm moving to Los Angeles soon and transitioning into the AI space. This blog isn't just about learning for fun - it's documenting a real career pivot happening in real time.

## The Bigger Picture (And Why You Should Care)

Here's what I'm convinced of: we're not just witnessing technological change. We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how work gets done. The people who learn to collaborate effectively with AI won't just have a competitive advantage - they'll be the ones shaping how this technology integrates into society.

But here's what you need to know: you don't need to become a programmer to be part of this transformation. You need to be curious, ethical, and willing to experiment.

Those are skills any professional can develop.

## Ready to Figure This Out Together?

Whether you're just starting to pay attention to AI or you've been dabbling but want to go deeper, I hope this becomes a useful resource. I'll share everything - the wins, the face-palm mistakes, the "aha!" moments, and the head-scratching confusion.

Because if a project manager from Columbus, Ohio can learn to use AI responsibly and effectively - and pivot their entire career around it - so can you.

**Your turn**: What's holding you back from experimenting with AI? Is it the technical intimidation factor, ethical concerns, or something else entirely? I'd love to hear your story in the comments below.

*Next week: I'll walk you through my first real AI experiment - building that stock analysis tool I mentioned. No coding required, just clear thinking and good communication. Subscribe to follow along.*
