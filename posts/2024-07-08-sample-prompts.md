Effective prompting is an art form. Here are my top 10 prompts that have consistently delivered better results across different AI models.

## The Top 10 Prompts

1. **"Think step by step"** - Encourages logical reasoning
2. **"Explain like I'm 5"** - Gets simple, clear explanations
3. **"Provide pros and cons"** - Ensures balanced perspectives
4. **"Give me three different approaches"** - Generates creative alternatives
5. **"What questions should I be asking?"** - Helps uncover blind spots

## Why These Work

These prompts work because they:
- Structure the AI's thinking process
- Encourage comprehensive responses
- Help avoid bias and assumptions
- Make complex topics accessible

## Advanced Techniques

For more sophisticated prompting, try:
- **Role-playing**: "Act as a [expert/teacher/critic]"
- **Constraints**: "In exactly 100 words, explain..."
- **Examples**: "Like this example: [your example]"

Try these prompts in your next AI conversation and see the difference in response quality!
