*I almost threw $2,000 at a trending ETF before asking AI to fact-check the hype. What I discovered was shocking.*

- - -

## TL;DR

Saw ULTY ETF trending on X with claims of "85% yields" and weekly payouts. Red flags went off, so I used AI to analyze it properly. Turns out it had dropped 68% since launch and 100% of distributions were just returning my own money back to me. AI analysis revealed the math behind the marketing hype. Also checked BTCI (Bitcoin income ETF) and found similar issues. The lesson: use AI to verify social media investment claims before investing.

## The Twitter Rabbit Hole That Almost Cost Me Everything

So I'm scrolling through X during lunch when this financial influencer's post catches my eye. Screenshots of weekly payouts everywhere. Claims of "80%+ yields." Rocket ship emojis all over the place.

The comments were wild. People sharing their "massive gains" and telling others to "get in before it's too late."

This is how I discovered **ULTY (YieldMax Ultra Option Income Strategy ETF)**.

The account looked legit. Decent following, professional charts. They were calling ULTY the "holy grail of income investing." Weekly distributions with an 85% annual yield. The post was getting hundreds of likes and retweets. People were posting screenshots of their Robinhood accounts showing weekly dividend payments.

But something felt off.

You know that feeling when promises sound too good? The classic red flags were there. Promises of easy money with minimal risk. Heavy focus on yield without explaining how it actually worked. Social proof everywhere. Urgency tactics about missing out.

Instead of throwing my $2,000 at what looked like easy money, I decided to try something different. I'd collaborate with AI to actually research this thing properly.

What happened next saved me from a costly mistake.

## The Deep Analysis That Changed Everything

Rather than trusting social media hype, I asked Claude (my AI assistant) to do a real analysis of ULTY. No emotional bias. No social proof pressure. Just data.

Here's what we found.

ULTY had dropped **68% since launching** in February 2024. The fund's recent distributions were **100% return of capital**. That means you're basically getting your own money back. The expense ratio was **1.30%**, which is pretty high. And the fund had concentrated exposure to volatile stocks with capped upside.

The AI's verdict was brutal but honest. **Grade D+.**

"Your nervousness about ULTY's downward trajectory is absolutely justified," the analysis said. "Recent distributions are 100% return of capital and 0% actual income. You're essentially getting your own money back."

This wasn't just number crunching. It was connecting dots that could have saved me serious money. The AI didn't just say ULTY was bad. It explained why in terms I could actually understand.

The fund uses a covered call strategy on volatile stocks. When you sell covered calls, you collect premiums upfront but cap your upside. If the underlying stocks drop (which they did), your fund value falls but you don't get the full protection you'd expect. Meanwhile, the "income" you're receiving is mostly just your own principal being returned to you.

## The Bitcoin Detour

I wanted crypto exposure, so I asked about **BTCI (NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF)**. Same thorough analysis. Compared it to spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC.

The findings were just as eye-opening.

BTCI only captures about **50% of Bitcoin's upside** because of covered call caps. The expense ratio is **0.98% versus 0.20-0.25%** for spot Bitcoin ETFs. And **96% of distributions were return of capital**. Same principal erosion problem as ULTY.

Since BTCI launched in October 2024, it returned 38% while Bitcoin itself gained 48% in the same timeframe. You're paying almost 1% in fees to get worse Bitcoin exposure and distributions that eat your principal.

The recommendation was clear. Skip BTCI entirely. Go with spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT or FBTC for actual exposure.

## The Social Media vs. AI Analysis Gap

This whole experience showed me something important. There's a huge gap between social media hype and actual analysis.

**What I saw on X** "ULTY paying me $200/week!" "85% yield is INSANE!" Screenshots of weekly dividend payments "Get in before everyone catches on!"

**What AI analysis showed** 68% price decline since launch 100% return of capital (not real income) High fees eating returns Unsustainable yield structure

The influencer's followers were celebrating getting their own money back while their principal disappeared. The AI helped me see through the noise to the actual math.

I'm not trying to bash social media here. But we need better tools to verify claims. AI gave me the analytical power to cut through marketing speak and emotional manipulation.

## Why This Matters More Than Ever

Social media has become the primary way retail investors discover new opportunities. The problem is that the incentives are all wrong. Influencers get paid for engagement, not for your investment returns. The flashier the claim, the more attention it gets.

AI doesn't have these conflicts of interest. It can analyze the actual data without being influenced by social proof, FOMO, or the need to create viral content.

The contrast hit me hard. Social media showed cherry-picked success stories and weekly payout screenshots. AI analysis revealed the math. A fund systematically returning investors' own capital while charging high fees.

## What I Learned About Using AI for Investment Research

**Start with the right questions.** Don't ask "Is this good?" Ask "What are the risks I'm not seeing?" and "How does this actually work?"

**Look for conflicts of interest.** When someone's promoting an investment on social media, ask AI to analyze their potential motivations and the actual track record.

**Focus on the mechanics.** AI is great at explaining how financial products actually work, not just what they claim to do.

**Get multiple perspectives.** I asked for comparisons to similar products and alternatives. This showed me better options I hadn't considered.

**Verify specific claims.** Those "85% yield" claims sound impressive until AI shows you it's mostly return of capital.

## The Big Picture

This experience was my first real taste of what AI-assisted investing could look like. Instead of relying on gut feelings, social proof, or marketing materials, I had access to objective, data-driven analysis.

But this was just the beginning. After avoiding those yield traps, I still had my original problem. I wanted to turn $2,000 into something meaningful. That's where things got really interesting.

In Part 2, I'll show you how the AI helped me design an aggressive but systematic growth strategy, complete with a custom trading app that keeps me disciplined. The tools and approach we developed together ended up being more valuable than any individual stock pick.
